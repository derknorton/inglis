## Inglıx
Inglıx is a complete phonetic alphabet for spoken English. Each of its 34
characters has one unique sound making it easy to learn to read and write by
someone who already understands spoken English. The goal is to allow school
age children, ESL students, and special needs students that are on the Autism
spectrum to learn to read and write in a few months rather than the many years
it took the rest of us to learn using the traditional English alphabet.
